# Heart of the Valley
There are so many incredible murals and public art in San José, California. This data visualization map is to help community members find public art and murals. 

This project came out of a discussion with community members and [Empire Seven Studios](https://www.empiresevenstudios.com/), a local art studio located in Japantown, San José, California. For the initial version of the map, Yan-Yin Choy researched local public art and murals from online sources, Instagram, and Facebook. Images are either linked from the online sources; all downloaded images in the ```Img``` folder include sources in the name of the file. 

The data is updated as of March 27, 2018. If there are any murals or public artworks missing, please submit the data as an issue, or in our [contact form](http://www.codeforsanjose.com/heartofthevalley/about.html)
