# Heart of the Valley
There are so many incredible murals and public art in San José, California. This data visualization map is to help community members find public art and murals in our community. 

This project came out of a discussion with community members and [Empire Seven Studios](https://www.empiresevenstudios.com/), a local art studio located in Japantown, San José, California. The data is updated as of March 27, 2018. If there are any murals or public artworks missing, please submit the data as an issue, or in our [contact form](http://www.codeforsanjose.com/heartofthevalley/about.html)
