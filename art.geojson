        "description": "Aaron De La Cruz writes: I remembered taking trips with my Grandmother to the Fulton Mall (located in Downtown Fresno, CA) back in the mid 1980’s. The exterior of the mall had a water feature that ran through the walkway, connecting all the stores. There were many large scale sculptures and water fountains throughout. At the time, I didn’t pay attention to the artwork I was being exposed to, but it did capture my attention. What I’m trying to get at is, I recently found out that one of those sculptures was created by artist Pierre Auguste Renoir and is the only one in the world that the public can actually touch. I liked the idea that this work of art that some would consider inaccessible, was placed where some people could care less about it. I then started to think about all of the large public art pieces I was exposed to as a youth and how I remember thinking, “How could a person create something of that scale with their hands?” I happily accepted the offer, and here is the result.",
        "artist": "Aaron De La Cruz",
        "biography": "Aaron De La Cruz's work, though minimal and direct at first, tends to overcome barriers of separation and freely steps in and out of the realms of painting and design. The act and the marks themselves are very simple but tend to take on distinct and sometimes higher meanings in the broad range of mediums and contexts they appear in and on. His work finds strengths in the reduction of his interests in life to minimal information. De La Cruz gains from the idea of exclusion, just because you don't literally see it, doesn't mean that it's not there.",

This recent wall marks the first of many that I plan to do, which would depict the cultural landscape of San Jose through observations and interviews of its residents. This will result in pieces that could only be found in San Jose.' Rodriquez was assisted in the execution of the wall by community volunteers. 'A lot of the people who helped out cared as much, if not more, about the painting than I did,” the artist says. 'They held up the standards as I would for my own paintings.' Some of the youth involved in an intervention program (Teaching Adolescents Skills in the Community), who worked on the mural, came back after the mural was finished and proudly showed family members their work.",

The focus on this mural was the Mayfair neighborhood where the inspiring leader Cesar Chavez once lived. This area was known as 'Sal Si Puede' (leave if you can), a twist on the United Farm Workers campaign slogan 'Si Se Puede' (Yes You Can). Though rich in culture, it's residents, mostly Mexican and other Latino groups, have historically experienced income, and justice inequality along with negative press. Today, it is good to see positive movement blooming throughout the area, as many grassroots efforts are being made to push East San Jose more toward a 'Si Se Puede' environment.'",

        "biography": "Sam Rodriguez is an artist based out of San José, CA and have been fortunate to have had shown his work in public art spaces, museums, companies, galleries, internet, and editorial publications. For a number of years he was self-taught through the graffiti scene, until he later decided to expand his studies by pursuing a Bachelor in Fine Arts from California College of the Arts.  He has since blended what he absorbed from both experiences to create his current style.  At the moment, he is interested in two types of portraiture that he calls, 'Topographical Portraiture' and 'Type Faces'.  Topographical Portraits, are made by stylizing a portrait with topographical lines and shapes in a similar manner to those found through images on geographic maps. Type Faces, incorporate typography and portraiture. He developed these through countless studio sessions, to use as a platform for his interest in social, historic, and cultural hybridity.",
